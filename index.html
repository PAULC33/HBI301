    <section class="resume-section p-3 p-lg-5 d-flex align-items-center" id="additional">
      <div class="w-100">
        <h2 class="mb-5">Additional Information</h2>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">THE TOOLS USED FOR WEBSITE DESIGN AND WHY THEY WERE SELECTED:</div>
        <p>Bootstrap themes were downloaded, loaded into Github and the html index was altered on Atom. Below is a summary of why and how each was used to make web development for a beginner simpler and deliver a more polished final product:</p>
        <p class="mb-0">1. BOOTSTRAP: the themes are ready made, and as they are open source they can be downloaded and used with no purchasing or licensing issues. They have a cohesive aesthetic making for a visually appealing aesthetic and can be easily customised by beginners to give a nice design with minimal know-how. They have a very efficient grid system already implemented, allowing for accessible layouts and navigation. The themes are also already compatible with standard desktops, laptops, tablets and phones, adjusting dimensions and layouts accordingly, as well as being compatible with all modern browsers. There is also a wealth of documentation so any issues or queries are easily resolved.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">2. GITHUB: the main benefit of GitHub is that it is a repository, meaning all code is stored in a cloud and can be accessed from anywhere and altered by anyone with permission, making collaborative projects and mobile working more efficient. It has a web-based GUI and there is also lots of existing documentation, meaning for beginners who want to learn it is the ideal start - nearly all problems will have been encountered before. GitHub makes it fast and easy to implement new changes, the site should automatically update with each saved change to the index and the code can also be sectioned into branches, so any necessary alterations can be made and then the new code can be slotted back into the core code for minimal disruption and no bugs.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">3. ATOM: ATOM is the perfect combination of flexibility in function and ease of usability, meaning it is a good jump start webpage editor but if the user wishes to expand further on their website then they can, as all the tools are available.</p>
        <p class="mb-0"> </p>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">HOW TO REGISTER AND SET UP THE DOMAIN NAME OF THE WEBSITE</div>
        <p class="mb-0">Firstly, search a database of domain names that are currently registered to ensure the one you want does not exist yet.  Then think through the name choice: it should make a positive first impression, efficiently get across the company branding or message and contain keywords to increase SEO (search engine optimisation), making it easier for potential clientele to find you even if they don’t have an exact match search. Other important considerations for the name include: availability across social media platforms for optimisation of marketing and branding on all fronts, avoiding hyphens and numbers (it should be easy to type) and using the correct extension - “.com” is still the most effective. Nominet is the official registry of UK domain names, so register the .com and .co.uk variations simultaneously. Finally, once your domain is registered you need to link it to the website and to the servers that website is hosted on. This is done through the Domain Name System (DNS), which links information to certain domain names assigned to all participating entities.</p>
        <p class="mb-0"> </p>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">WEBSITES:</div>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">i. What makes a good website?</div>
        <p class="mb-0">In short, a good website is clear and concise in getting its message across. It must be eye catching and aesthetically pleasing (meaning a cohesive colour scheme and thematic imagery which fits the narrative) while ideally being minimalist and not distracting from the information being presented.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">The clear message presented first must then be supported with lots of additional content which elaborates on and further emphasises the meaning behind your message or the necessity of your product. This content must be laid out cleanly and be easy for users to navigate around - a messy website is a bad website.</p>
        <br/>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">ii. Website Accessibility and any Considerations you have made:</div>
        <p class="mb-0">A good website must be fully accessible - meaning no barriers preventing people with disabilities on the internet interacting with it or utilising all its functions. This can include the visually impaired (small type and awkward/illegible fonts can be hard to discern and prevent them reading the information presented) or even the audibly impaired. These issues can be overcome by using close-captioned videos to narrate what is going on so deaf people can understand or having options to increase font sizes for easier viewing. Websites should ideally meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) developed by W3C – the international standards organisation for the World Wide Web. Examples put forward by this body in the Web Accessibility Initiative include:</p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          <ul>
            <li>Alternative text for images so blind people using screen readers can access all facets of the webpage in alternative ways</li>
            <li>All functionality available from the keyboard, as some people with limitations to their fine motor control can’t use a mouse.</li>
            <li>Transcripts available for audio files and closed captioning on videos so deaf people can comprehend the information being presented.</li>
            <li>Warnings for flashing content capable of causing seizures and the options available to the user of seeing the site without.</li>
            <li>No time restraints on how slowly users can read and absorb the information being presented.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0"> </p>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">iii. GDPR Summary; what considerations have we made?</div>
        <p class="mb-0">GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is a collection of guidelines making up the legal framework within the EU for how websites can collect and process individual’s data as they visit their websites. It replaced the 1995 Data Protection Act in the UK and in full has 99 articles outlined in an 88-page long report, however the 7 main guiding principles are as follows:</p>
        <p class="mb-0">
          <ol>
            <li>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency: data must be collected/stored/processed in a lawful way meeting all standards set out in the GDPR guidelines. You must also only use for the purpose specified to the user and for the specified time limit – keeping data beyond when you said you would/using it for something other than the intended purpose is unlawful. Transparency means the user must be fully informed on the purposes and retainer time period set out.</li>
            <li>Purpose limitation: meaning you must inform all users to the purpose of the data collection and all data collected can only be used for these purposes.</li>
            <li>Data minimisation: under the GDP guidelines you must justify the amount of data you are collecting, meaning an acceptable policy must be in place and all data collection must be documented. Collected personal data must be relevant and limited to what is necessary.</li>
            <li>Accuracy: all stored data must be accurate and so it should be kept up to date. Outdated contacts and inaccurate personal data must be erased.</li>
            <li>Storage limitation: a retention period must be set for all data that could be used to identify data subjects, and once this retention period is exceeded all data must be erased. This retention period must be justifiable if called into question and all collection/erasing must be documented.</li>
            <li>Integrity and Confidentiality (Security): all collected data must be protected against unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or damage. Anonymisation of data must be put in place to protect client’s identity should there ever be a breach.</li>
            <li>Accountability: full compliance with the policies set out and justified in formats specified in the official documentation. If a company becomes aware of a breach in their cyber security, they must report the notifiable breach to the no later than 72 hours after becoming aware of it.</li>
          </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-0"> </p>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">iv. What marketing techniques best generate web traffic?</div>
        <p class="mb-0">
          <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
            <li>Social media marketing: targeted ads towards people with an interest in biological wet laboratory work/biochemistry, as they will most likely be the ones purchasing the product. Combine this with an active social media presence; companies perceived as “friendly” tend to do better, so put a smiling face on instagram in some “behind the scenes” manufacturing/production shots to develop a more personal connection with users.</li>
            <li>Captive audience is the best audience: keep them coming back by including a mailing list/subscription button and notifying all members of any updates to the product/pricing/business plan.</li>
            <li>Promotional demonstrations/free “sample product” to large institutions or companies that will likely buy more if they find it simplifies their lab work i.e. give the Imperial biochemistry department one and let them see for themselves how much easier their lives are with this product in it.</li>
            <li>Display advertising through Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) i.e. when a user inputs any of a specified set of key phrases into a search engine, our website pops up at the top of the list as an ad.</li>
            <li>Piggybacking this suggestion, implement schema microdata in your web code. Schema.org is a semantics/vocabulary database, which tags keywords and phrases on your site, making them easier to be catalogued by search engines and displayed on Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs).</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <div class="subheading mb-3">v. What future steps would you take to expand on your website provided with additional time?</div>
        <p class="mb-0"> </p>
        <br/>


        <p>Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skier and novice ice climber. During the warmer months here in Colorado, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
